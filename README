SloopSQL - free SQL tool for Android

SloopSQL will be a free SQL tool for Android, allowing viewing and querying
SQL data from any accessible Android data provider.

Currently, this is in the very earliest stages of development, and doesn't do
much.

This app is also an experiment, to see if mobile devices are mature enough to
serve as a software-development platform.  I'm creating SloopSQL entirely on
Android devices, using the AIDE development environment.  No laptop or desktop
computer will touch this application during its development cycle, at least 
until more contributors are involved.
